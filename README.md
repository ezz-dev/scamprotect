# ScamProtect

> Unfortunately, this public version of ScamProtect will not be updated. We need to be a closed-source project, because the people who are engaged in scam know about us and come up with new bypasses. Thank you for understanding.

A Discord bot written in Python, created to protect your server from "Steam Nitro" and etc. scam messages.

**To make this bot fully works you need a stable always-online PHP webserver to store your bot settings and other data**.

### Current features:
 - Embed scanning;
 - Known scam links detection;
 - Message pattern detection.
 - Changeable prefix and settings (`!prefix`, `!disabledms` and more);
 - Manual message scanning (`!clear` and `!clearall` commands).
 
### Todo:
 - AI scanner to detect scam messages with unregistred pattern;
 - Add more user-changeable settings.
